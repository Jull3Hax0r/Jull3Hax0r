  Hello. I am currently studying at Hack The Box Academy and Try Hack Me and doing some boxes to take their certificate for pentesting. Here I will post things mostly for my own sake, for example various bash scripts that might be good to have and later possibly my own tools. I mostly write in Python.

I love computers / IT, but above all security and hacking (white hat / ethical only!).
I'm learning a lot every day:)

Here you'll find some things I'm working on, but I'm not very active here at the moment because I'm busy with THM and HTB, but I'll try to put some things here over time.
