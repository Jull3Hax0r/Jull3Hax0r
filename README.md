  Hello.
  I love computers / IT, but above all security and hacking.
  I  be doing a lot of CTFs on TryhackMe atm, so I'll be posting some writeups and tools I've created in connection with certain labs / CTFs.
  Here you'll find some things I'm working on, Keep an eye open, new things will come when you least expect it :D
